## The Evolution of Accessibility

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) continues to evolve, with a strong focus on **accessibility** and **inclusivity**. Recent conferences have highlighted the importance of designing for diverse user needs, including those with visual impairments.

### Key Areas of Interest

1.  **Multimodal Interfaces**: Combining haptic, auditory, and visual feedback to create richer experiences.
2.  **AI-Assisted Accessibility**: Using generative AI to provide real-time image descriptions and navigation assistance.
3.  **Digital Nature**: Exploring the boundary between digital and physical realities, a concept championed by researchers like Yoichi Ochiai.

As a researcher in this field, I am particularly interested in how we can use technology to bridge the gap for users with disabilities.
