## A Morning Ritual

Away from the screen and code, I find solace in the ritual of brewing coffee. The precision required for a perfect pour-over resonates with my engineering mindset, yet it is a purely sensory experience.

### My Setup

-   **Beans**: Light roast, single-origin (Ethiopia Yirgacheffe is a favorite).
-   **Grinder**: Burr grinder for consistent particle size.
-   **Method**: V60 or Kalita Wave.

The bloom, the aroma, and that first sip—it's the perfect way to start a day of problem-solving.
